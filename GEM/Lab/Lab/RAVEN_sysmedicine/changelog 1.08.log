-Fixed a bug in getEssentialRxns which caused it to misinterpret some problems as infeasible
-Fixed a bug in randomSampling where it could miss that a problem was infeasible
-Added a setting to convertToIrrev to only split some subset of the reversible reactions
-Fixed a bug in getModelFromHomology regarding quotation marks in the description field
-Fixed a bug in getKEGGModelForOrganism for some combination of settings
-Added the getRxnsInComp function
-Changed in checkRxn to hide an annoying warning
-Fixed a bug in copyToComps which caused the model to be renamed
-Added the cleanBadChars and cleanBadCharsInModel functions for ensuring that illegal characters are dealt with before generation of SBML files
-Fixed a bug in checkRxns which caused an error for some combination of inputs
-Fixed a bug in getBlast when using multiple reference files
-Fixed a bug in getModelFromHomology for some combination of parameters
-Added a setting to constructS for printing more detailed warnings/errors. The purpose was to be able to use it as the general parsing function for importExcelModel
-Added the checkModelStruct function
-Fixed a bug in predictLocalization for some models without gene complexes
-Fixed a bug in removeBadRxns
-Changed in parseFormulas so that all elements can be used in metabolite composition. This also required changes in getElementalBalance, printFluxes, printModelStats and removeBadRxns
-Fixed a bug in predictLocalization which could result in an Index out of bounds error in some cases when using only two compartments
-Added an option to use different transportCosts for each metabolite to predictLocalization
-Rewrote how import/output of models work. Instead of using SBMLFromExcel followed by importModel, it is now possible to use importExcelModel directly. Most of the checks which were performed in SBMLFromExcel have now been moved to checkModelStruct, which can then also be used for any model structure. checkModelStruct is also called from importModel/importExcelModel. The report about dead-end reactions and similar issues which do not relate directly to the model structure as such have been moved to printModelStats. The exportModel function has been rewritten and is now equally exact as first exporting to Excel format and then to SBML from there. The overall ambition with the rewrite was to modularize the input/output and make it easier to perform quality controls of model structures without going via Excel. SBMLFromExcel is now just a wrapper for importExcelModel+exportModel. Another reason was to get rid of largely redundant code in SBMLFromExcel/importModel/exportModel. This work resulted in some small changes to the Excel model format and the Matlab model structure.
	-The "SBO TERM" column for reactions is no longer used and no SBO terms are incorporated in the SBML file
	-Differences in upper/lower case when matching metabolites and reactions are now considered errors rather than warnings
	-The model structure has an added "annotation" field used for meta data
	-Several Miriam terms can now be delimited with ";"
	-"Gene ID 1", "Gene ID 2" and "KEGG MAPS" in the  GENE sheet have been removed and "MIRIAM" has been added
	-"GO TERM" has been removed from the COMPS sheet and "MIRIAM" has been added
	-"MIRIAM" had been added to the RXNS sheet
	-The model structure can now contain the fields "rxnComps", "rxnMiriams", "compMiriams", "geneMiriams" and "geneComps"
	-The model field geneShortName is no longer used
	-The naming of columns in Excel sheets have changed to be "ID" & "NAME" for RXNS and METS, "ID" & "DESCRIPTION" for
	 MODEL, "NAME" for GENES and "ABBREVIATION" & "NAME" for COMPS. The old captions still work as well.
-Added support for importing MS Excel files on non-Windows operating systems. This makes use of Oracle POI
-Changed in getKEGGModelForOrganism so that a model for an organism which is already in KEGG could be generated without any sequence data
-Changed in getAllSubGraphs so that it doesn't rely on the Graph toolbox
-Fixed a bug in guessComposition which gave errors for some polymers
-Fixed a bug in addRxns
