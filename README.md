Deseq2 and functional analysis over a diet data  

_By FarukOzderim_  

Data:  
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA292382

This data has 3 diets + 1 control diet over musmusculus. It is a study with name "Omega-3 fatty acids partially revert the metabolic gene expression profile induced by long-term calorie restriction". Dataset contains single raw RNA information from liver and muscle.


You can run all the steps except deseq2 analysis with

```shell
bash scriptForAll.sh
```

be careful that it will download 40gb of data and run ~8 hours after download.

You can use metadataLike.txt and differentiate liver and muscle data like in 

-results/muscle/data

-results/liver/data

-results/muscle/metadata.txt

-results/liver/metadata.txt


and run script1.r to script4.r with R. That will apply deseq2 and functional analysis.
